# JSON2CSV
Python script to convert json files to csv files in the current working directory

## Usage
Place the JSON files in the same directory as the script. The JSON file must be an Array of Objects or Multidimensional Array.

Navigate to the directory where the script exists and begin by typing `python json_csv.py`

The script will convert all the JSON files to the CSV files using the same name. If the converted file's name exists a `(1)` will be added to the basename of the converted file.

## Credits
Original script was written by [jhsu98](https://github.com/jhsu98) which works for only one file. Check [this repo](https://github.com/jhsu98/json-csv-converter) for more details
